Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
AmazeFileManager-3.5.2,com.amaze.filemanager.ui.activities,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.amaze.filemanager.test; com.amaze.filemanager.ui.views.appbar; com.amaze.filemanager.ui.views.drawer; com.amaze.filemanager.asynchronous.asynctasks; com.amaze.filemanager.ui.fragments; com.amaze.filemanager.ui.dialogs; com.amaze.filemanager.asynchronous.services
AmazeFileManager-3.5.2,com.amaze.filemanager.ui.activities,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [TextEditorActivityEspressoTest]; [MainActivityTest; MainActivity; MainActivity.FabActionListener; PreferencesActivity; PreferencesActivityTest]; [TextEditorActivityTest; TextEditorActivity]; [AboutActivity]; [DatabaseViewerActivity]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5
AmazeFileManager-3.5.2,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 10.16.
