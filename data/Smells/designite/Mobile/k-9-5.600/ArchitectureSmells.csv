Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
k-9-5.600,com.fsck.k9.mail.ssl,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [TrustManagerFactoryTest; LocalKeyStore; LocalKeyStore.LocalKeyStoreHolder; TrustManagerFactory; DefaultTrustedSocketFactory; TrustedSocketFactory]; [KeyChainKeyManager]; [TrustManagerFactory.SecureX509TrustManager]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38
k-9-5.600,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 11.19.
