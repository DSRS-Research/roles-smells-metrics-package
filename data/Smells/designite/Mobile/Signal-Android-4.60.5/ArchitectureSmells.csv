Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
Signal-Android-4.60.5,org.thoughtcrime.securesms.lock,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.thoughtcrime.securesms.pin
Signal-Android-4.60.5,org.thoughtcrime.securesms.lock,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [PinHashing_hashPin_Test; PinHashing]; [RegistrationLockReminders; RegistrationLockV1Dialog; SignalPinReminderDialog]; [SignalPinReminders]; [SignalPinReminderDialog.V1PinVerifier]; [SignalPinReminderDialog.V2PinVerifier]; [SignalPinReminderDialog.PinVerifier]; [SignalPinReminderDialog.Callback]; [SignalPinReminderDialog.Launcher]; [SignalPinReminderDialog.Callback]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.75
Signal-Android-4.60.5,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 14.62.
